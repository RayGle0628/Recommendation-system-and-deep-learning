# Recommendation-system-and-deep-learning
The recommendation algorithm has many application scenarios and great commercial value. 
There are many types of recommendation algorithms. Currently, the most widely used recommendation algorithms are recommendation algorithms 
based on collaborative filtering. In 2016, as AlphaGo shines, a new wave of deep learning has arrived. In the fields of image and audio 
processing, deep learning technology has become a well-deserved king; but in the field of 
recommendation, deep learning is still in the development stage.



This library introduces deep learning recommendation technologies that have been proven to be effective, 
including technical applications such as Word2Vec, Wide & Deep, DeepFM, and GAN, and gives relevant practical codes; 
in addition to explaining the implementation of the
recommendation system at the algorithm level, It also elaborates how to build the recommendation system from the engineering level.
